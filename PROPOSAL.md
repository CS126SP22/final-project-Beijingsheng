My project is going to be a bus route_ animation generator. The application I am building is going to generate animations of buses moving on a map following certain routes.

Required background knowledge including 1) Reading, editing, saving JSON files. 2) Visualizing animation. 3) Reading user input and providing feedbacks.

By week 1, I will have most of the data reading, editing, and saving part done. I will also have most of the test cases written.
By week 2, I will have most of the visualization, without user interaction with the graphic interface, done. I will have all the test cases written by then, too.
By week 3, I will have the data retriving and editing done, in addition to the user interaction with graphic interface done.
By week 4, I will have all the test cases passed.
