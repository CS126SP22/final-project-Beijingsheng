<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Wanna figure out if your cargo carrying system is well designed? Mini Cargo Simulator is the right solution. This is the app that perfectly suits your need to measure, analyze, and improve your cargo carrying system.

Here's why:
* By editing three json files, you will have a perfectly visualization of how well the cargo carrying system you designed performs in various situations.
* You will be able to measure the rationality of the placement of your cargo stations, the route of your carriers, and the designated departures and destinations.
* Improving your design and generate new visualization as easy as modifying values in json files.

Of course, no one simulator will serve all your needs. You may also suggest changes by connecting with me at clarklubeijing at gmail dot com. So I'll be adding more requested features in the near future.
